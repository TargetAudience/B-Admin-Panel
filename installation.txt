INSTALLATION AND SETUP
======================

I'm using MAMP Pro as my PHP and MySQL service. The regular MAMP should work fine as well.

We are using PHP 7.3.15 on the live server. I'm using 7.4.12 locally for development with no compatibility issues.

Next, install composer on your machine and run "composer install" or "composer update" from the command line where composer.json is located.

Next, add write permissions to system/smarty/templates_c and logs/portalapp.log.

Setup your local web server as normal and edit the system/configs/config.php file to reflect your local setup.

For config.php:
UPLOAD_FOLDER_MEDIA and UPLOAD_FOLDER point to the boomhealth-api as the images are stored there (for the time being).

We're going to be moving config.php to an .env file to make it easier for everyone.

Our shared development database is at:
